## PoreCamp Vancouver Highlights: a day-long training camp for the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer.
In 2018, Vancouver is proud to host the sixth edition of the [PoreCamp series](https://porecamp.github.io/), founded by Nick Loman, Matt Loose and Mick Watson in 2015. Due to overwhelming response to our call for applications for the full week-long camp, we have added a special, **one-day "highlights" camp** in order to give as many people as possible the opportunity to learn about MinION sequencing from the experts! PoreCamp Highlights will run **Friday, May 4** on the UBC campus.

PoreCamp Highlights is a one-day training workshop based around Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)’s [MinION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion) sequencing system. The highlights workshop is a unique opportunity to learn from some of the leading experts in the field in a condensed format. The morning will feature lectures from our instructor team ([Nick Loman](http://lab.loman.net/), [Josh Quick](http://lab.loman.net/), [Matt Loose](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/life-sciences/people/matt.loose), [John Tyson](http://snutchlab.msl.ubc.ca/labmembers/), [Jared Simpson](http://simpsonlab.github.io/), and [Lauren Cowley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t2_rH0kAAAAJ&hl=en), while the afternoon will feature live demos of library prep, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis. The event will conclude with a reception, and a chance to ask questions of your faculty - experts in their field.

## What is nanopore sequencing?
The [Oxford Nanopore MinION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion) is a USB-size DNA sequencer which is capable of producing 10-20 Gbase of sequence data with read lengths as high as hundreds of kilobases. One of its key advantages is to produce data in near-real time - the system has been used to monitor the [Ebola outbreak](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v530/n7589/full/nature16996.html) in 2015, the [Zika outbreak](http://zibraproject.github.io/) in 2016, and in July 2016 the MinION became the [first sequencer in space](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/2181.html). The Porecamp instructors recently [sequenced a whole human genome](http://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878) with this technology.

## How is the Highlights workshop different from the full camp?
With the Highlights workshop, we are offering a condensed version of the full camp learning experience. You'll have a half-day, rather than a full day, of lectures, and instead of doing library prep, sequencing, and bioinformatics in a hands-on fashion over three full days, you'll observe live, real-time demos run by our instructors. The one-day camp is ideal for:
* researchers curious about the MinION but not yet working with one
* PIs who can only fit a day of training into their schedules
* anyone whose schedule or budget doesn't permit a full week of training

## When and where will PoreCamp Vancouver take place?
The workshop will run all day **Friday, May 4, 2018**. We’ll be based at the [Michael Smith Laboratories](http://www.msl.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). For more details on getting to UBC, including accommodation options, click [here](location.md).
